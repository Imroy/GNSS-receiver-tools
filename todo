 - Complete message classes
 - Make a unified parser
  - Take advantage of both NMEA-0183 and binary messages ending with 0x0d 0x0a
  - Need a common base class for messages?
  - Change parse_messages into parse_message, more like parse_sentence
    i.e it parses only one message that has already been picked out

 - Make a function that allows a binary query/get message to be sent and waits for the response
  - Throws an exception if a NACK is received

 - Make a listener function that calls callback functions/methods when messages are received
  - Used by previous function?
